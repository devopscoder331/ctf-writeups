### Description:
Ok, so turns out it’s quite dangerous not to commit to some of the polynomials, who could have known. This year we threw out all of that dangerous logup logic, so it’s just standard plonk gates with sumcheck now. Nothing could go wrong. (Send a proof for the impossible circuit in testing circuits if you think otherwise)

hint: Can you spoof the multilinear polynomial commitment opening?
